# Mobile Formset Remove Button Optimization

## Problem
The "Remove" buttons in formsets (Education, Projects, Experience, Skills, Languages, Certifications) were too large on mobile devices, taking up too much horizontal space and making the interface cramped.

## Solution
Created responsive CSS that transforms the remove buttons on mobile devices:

### Desktop (≥769px)
- Shows full button with icon + "Remove" text
- Normal button styling and size

### Mobile (≤768px)
- Shows only the trash icon
- Button becomes circular (border-radius: 50%)
- Reduced padding and size
- Touch-friendly minimum size (44px)

### Extra Small Mobile (≤480px)
- Even smaller button (40px)
- Smaller icon size (14px)

## Implementation

### Files Created
- `static/css/mobile_formset_buttons.css` - Responsive CSS for remove buttons

### Files Modified
- `templates/portfolio/base.html` - Added CSS link to base template

### CSS Approach
1. **Hide text**: Set `font-size: 0` on the button to hide all text
2. **Show icon**: Set `font-size: 16px` on the icon to make it visible
3. **Responsive design**: Use media queries for different screen sizes
4. **Touch optimization**: Ensure minimum 44px touch target size

## Affected Templates
The CSS automatically applies to all these formset templates:
- `education_formset.html`
- `project_formset.html`
- `experience_form.html`
- `skill_formset.html`
- `add_language.html`
- `add_certification.html`

## Features
- ✅ Responsive design (desktop vs mobile)
- ✅ Touch-friendly button sizes
- ✅ Smooth transitions and hover effects
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Accessibility compliance (minimum touch target)
- ✅ No JavaScript required (pure CSS solution)

## Testing
To test the mobile optimization:
1. Open any formset page (e.g., `/languages/25/`)
2. Add multiple entries using "Add Another"
3. Resize browser window to mobile size (≤768px)
4. Verify remove buttons show only icons
5. Test on actual mobile device for touch interaction

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with CSS media query support
- Graceful degradation on older browsers
- Works with all current mobile browsers
